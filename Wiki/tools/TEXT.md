# TEXT

![Tool](https://i.imgur.com/yUuZO4D.gif)

**Description:** *Text tool. Click on a spot to place text, you can drag the marker before placing.*

Type text into the big textbox above. No newlines will be created unless you type ENTER, even if 
the text appears to wrap in the box. You can type an element name into the box for what the text is made out of (Default DMND). The text alignment is relative to a vertical line defined by where the marker is.

Spacing is in terms of line height, which varies depending on the font you use. 1x means no space between characters vertically, 2x mean 1 character height's worth of space. While typing you can drag the marker (the circle) around to change where the text is placed.

Several fonts can be used:
- **4x4 Block:** A very small alphanumeric block font. Lowercase is same as uppercase
- **3x5 Mono:** A small 3x5 monospaced font
- **4x7 TPT:** Default-like TPT font
- **7x10 Normal:** A big title
- **7x10 Bold:** A big bold title
