### Anti-hydrogen

![Element](https://i.imgur.com/8o8aTFb.gif)

**Description:**  *Anti-Hydrogen. Annihilates ordinary matter, undergoes fusion at high temperature and pressure.*

Anti-hydrogen is identical to hydrogen, except it burns faster. Upon touching a "normal" matter element (non-energy, not CLNE or VOID or portal or AMTR or indestructible), it will turn into a bunch of superheated photons, raise the local pressure by 10 and destroy whatever it touched.

When anti-hydrogen is over 50 pressure and heated to over 2000 C, 
it will transform into AMTR (tmp2=1) and release one NEUT, one yellow PHOT, and 
have a 10% chance of releasing one POSI. It will also generate one particle of PLSM, 
add 30 pressure, and raise its own temperature by 1000 ± 250 °C.

## Technical
#### Properties

Same as hydrogen, if any.
