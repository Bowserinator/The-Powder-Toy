# TIN

**Description:**  *Tin. Poorer heat conductor than most metals, has a low melting point.*

A light yellow-ish metal, has a much poorer heat conduction that most other metals (180). Melts at 232 C and breaks 
into BRKN (TIN) over 5 pressure. Tin reverses the corrosion of IRON like GOLD. TIN touching an empty space will have 
a chance to turn into an oxide layer (tmp = 1) that's 100% resistant to ACID and CAUS. This transformation is usually 
very fast, but if the outer oxide layer is scratched ACID and CAUS will have a chance to dissolve through the inner layers
of TIN.

Below 3.72 K TIN superconducts (both SPRK and RSPK).
