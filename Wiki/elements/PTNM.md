# PTNM
### Platinum

**Description:**  *Platinum. Catalyzes certain reactions*

A shiny metal catalyst. Immune to ACID and CAUS, melts at 1768 C, and conducts SPRK 2x faster than METL (like GOLD).

Many reactions:
- SHLD will grow on PTNM even without SPRK
- ISZS / ISOZ will instantly be split into PLUT and PHOT
- GAS + > 2 pressure + >= 200 C -> INSL + Heat
- BREL + > 1000 C + > 50 pressure -> EXOT - Heat
- SMKE -> CO2
- HYGN + DESL -> OIL + WATR
- HYGN + OXYG -> DSTW + SPRK + Heat
- 2 HYGN > 500 C small chance -> cold fusion
- COAL / BCOL + > 5 pressure -> SUFR
- Can be used a catalyst in the Haber process

Note that cold hydrogen fusion is vastly less effective than regular fusion, as the temperature and pressure increase 
is significantly lower, and the plasma from the noble is likely to ignite remaining hydrogen.
