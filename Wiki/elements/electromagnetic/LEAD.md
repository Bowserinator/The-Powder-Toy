# LEAD

![Really bad gif lol](https://i.imgur.com/2s8h0oc.gif)

**Description:**  *Soft metal with a low melting point. Blocks pressure, absorbs energy particles.*

Lead will block pressure (but not ambient heat). Conducts heat as well as BMTL. Can be deformed by pressure like GOO but won't disappear under pressure. Immune to VIRS but does not cure it. Kills STKM and BCTR. Absorbs all energy particles and adds 5% of their heat to its own. Has twice the delay between sparks as regular METL. Cannot recieve sparks from PSCN (but any other conductor works), can only output to PSCN.

Melts at 327 C, molten LEAD will destroy most electronics (turn them into BREL) when they're within a 5x5 square around the molten LEAD particle:
```
WIFI, ARAY, DRAY, CRAY, Anything in the powered section, FRAY, PSTN, FILT, HEAC,
Any sensor other than BJEL and INVS, SWCH, TESC, ETRD, INST, EMP
