# GRND

![Here's what this looks like lol](https://i.imgur.com/aV7BEBA.png)

**Description:**  *Electrical ground. Absorbs current, setting local voltage to 0.*

Acts as a reference for 0 V in a circuit (RSPK on a GRND will have voltage at node = 0).

Melts at 3000 K. Does not conduct ordinary SPRK.
