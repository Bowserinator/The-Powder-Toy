### Silicon

**Description:**  *Silicon. Temporarily turns on powered elements when sparked, cannot conduct spark on diagonals.*

Silicon melts at 1414 C. Sparked SLCN should activate most powered materials, and once the spark subsides the powered material should unpower. SPRK in SLCN can only go directly up, left, down or right, creating a more square diagonal spark pattern. This ON / OFF effect is floodfilled, allowing certain powered materials that don't normally instantly turn on to instantly turn on.

If > 400 C SLCN can be "doped". Touching hot SLCN with bismuth, molten bismuth, phosphorous or molten phosphorous has a chance to turn it into NSCN, and touching hot SLCN with aluminum, molten aluminum or ION will have a chance to turn it into PSCN.

Silicon does not block air. Silicon can conduct to NSCN, PSCN, INWR, INST, LEAD, NTCT, PTCT, QRTZ directly.
