# BRNZ
## Bronze

**Description:**  *Bronze. Kills bacteria, made from mixing copper and tin. Decelerates air.*

Melts at 950 C, dissolved by ACID and CAUS. Made by mixing molten COPR and molten TIN. In contact with air will 
slowly turn darker over time, this can be undone with VNGR, SOAP, or BAKS. Touching O2, WTRV, water, AMNA, ACID or CAUS will 
cause a greenish corrosion to appear like COPR. Reflects photons in same wavelength as COPR.

Air passing through will slow down, this makes BRNZ a medium pressure shield. BRNZ kills BCTR on contact.
