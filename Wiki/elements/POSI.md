# POSI
### Positron

**Description:**  *Positrons. Annihilates on contact with electrons, removes spark.*

Positrons (or anti electrons) move the same as electrons. If they hit an electron, they form a bright ember flash that doesn't move, as well as two hot photons moving in opposite directions. The faster the velocities they collide at, the more blue the photons are and the hotter they are.

Upon touching SPRK, it will be absorbed and remove the spark, but unlike PROT this removal is done with a floodfill, avoiding weird circuit loops occuring. It unscrambles any LCRY (scrambled by ELEC), repeled by PROT. turns BTRY to BRMT, lowers the EXOT countdown that ELEC does (disarms EXOT), turns DEUT into realistic hydrogen (RH2) and forms anti-hydrogen on contact with anti-protons or neutrons.

Like electrons, positrons turn into EMBR on contact with GLAS, and turn into PHOT inside of GLOW.
