###  Filler

**Description:**  *Filler. Does not interact with most elements, can be used for backgrounds.*

Invisible element, you can deco it and use it as backgrounds.

Doesn't interact with most elements - pretty much everything goes through, I'm mostly sure BOMB and DEST and VIRS and DFLM and such don't interact with it. ARAY and other beam creators might be blocked by FILL. FILL can be moved by PSTN.
