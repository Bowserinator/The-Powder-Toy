Burns for a while, emitting orange flame and ember. Melts at 280.5 C. White PHSP glows for 30 frames when it absorbs a photon, or 
when touching water vapor. Can be used to dope SLCN (See SLCN wiki). Fertilizes PLNT (changes it to VINE). White PHSP has a chance 
to randomly combust in the air.

PHOT or being > 70 C has a chance to turn PHSP into the red variant.
