# APRT
### Anti-protons

![Element](https://i.imgur.com/qIwbhHi.gif)

**Description:**  *Anti-Protons. Annihilates on contact with regular matter, sparks conductors.*

Anti-protons move the same as electrons. If they hit a proton they form a bright ember flash that doesn't move, as well as two hot photons moving in opposite directions. The faster the velocities they collide at, the more blue the photons are and the hotter they are. If an anti-proton hits a non-antimatter, non-energy element, it forms a bright ember flash that heats the element it collided with.

APRT sparks conductors just like ELEC. Inside of LCRY it turns into PHOT, inside of INVIS it turns into NEUT. APRT does not trigger DEUT, and creates slight positive pressure. APRT converts PLUT to URAN, URAN to POLO, and POLO to STNE. PHOT + ANH2 (anti-hydrogen) = POSI + APRT. APRT is repelled by ELEC. Splits water into H2 and O2.

APRT can fuse into elements, if 2 APRT traveling in nearly opposite directions collide at:

**> 10 total velocity** Fuses into ANH2

**> 20 total velocity** Fuses into realistic AMTR (AMTR, tmp2 = 1)

**> 70 total velocity** Fuses into SING
