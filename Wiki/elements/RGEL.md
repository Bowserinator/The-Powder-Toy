**Description:**  Repulsion Gel. Stains solids, washes with water. Very bouncy.

"Stains" solids, powders, and certain other elements (Replaces solids with a solid version of itself, this process can be undone with water). If it hasn't stained solids in a random amount of time it will decay. Can also stain moving solids, in which they become bouncy. It can only stain when in liquid form.

Turns into LAVA (ctype STNE) when heated to over 7000 K.
