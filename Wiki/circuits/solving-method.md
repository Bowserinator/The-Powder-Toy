# Circuit Solving Method

  

## 0. Identify circuits

  

## 1. Identify circuit nodes and edges (branches)

First we take the circuit starting point we identified and do a floodfill to get all conductors connected to the starting point.  The flood fill is just a standard stack based floodfill, where each pixel can fill a new pixel based on the following rules:

```
1. New coordinate hasn't been visited
2. Is a valid conductor
3. Isn't conducting from SWCH to PSCN or NSCN
4. Isn't conducting to INWR from anything other than INWR, a terminal or GRND
5. Isn't conducting from INWR to anything other than INWR, a terminal, GRND
```

There is a special case for junctions, which allow circuits to cross: you can't enter a junction on a diagonal (exit any direction, however), and when moving from one junction to another you must keep your original velocity (ie, if you came in from the top, you can only move straight down). Junctions ignore the "visited" map as you can visit a junction multiple times, and you cannot backtrack anyways.

Terminals:
```
Positive: PSCN, COPR
Negative: NSCN, ZINC
```

COPR / ZINC can be used as low-resistance alternatives to PSCN / NSCN

The last rule prevents RSPK blocking SPRK from toggling SWCH. Coordinates are added to a coordinate vector and returned.

All RSPK in the floodfill will have a circuit_map[id] set (maps particle ID to a pointer to the Circuit), their tmp set to: (0: not part of skeleton, 1: part of skeleton, 2 and above: their node ID).

---

Next, we apply the Zhang-Suen algorithm for image thinning to create a skeleton of the circuit:

![Skeletonization process](https://i.imgur.com/pyOXJlX.png)

Some circuit elements such as GRND and VOLT can only be trimmed if surrounded by a lot of other VOLT / GRND / etc..., this prevents
a 1 px ground from being trimmed from the circuit entirely, and it also prevents 100 nodes from forming in a blob of VOLT (compared to
preventing ANY VOLT / GRND / etc... from being trimmed).

Next, we identify nodes by the following criteria (blue in above diagram). We consider "nodes" as junctions where parts of the skeleton branch, as all wires (aside from superconductors) have resistance, so nodes can't simply be placed between resistors. Rather, we consider the entire wire as one large resistor (Other components detailed later).

Furthermore, we would also like the points beside voltage sources such as capacitors and VOLT to be marked as nodes for nodal analysis.

This is documented in a comment in simulation/circuits/circuits.cpp, which is summarized as follows:

```
A node is any pixel of the skeleton that has more than 2 surrounding pixels that are also
part of the skeleton. A surrounding pixel is not counted if it is directly adjacent to 
another surrounding pixel that's on the diagonal.

A positive terminal to voltage source type, such as VOLT and CPTR is a node
A negative terminal to voltage source type, such as VOLT and CPTR is a node
PSCN to NSCN or NSCN to PSCN (a p-n junction diode)
The current pixel is a ground
```

For positive / negative terminal nodes, finding directly adjacent takes priority over diagonally adjacent, as diagonally adjacent can be trimmed.

![Valid node diagram](https://i.imgur.com/PdtHwar.png)

By convention, diagonals take priority over directly adjacent. This is because of the skeletonization algorithm: it's very unlikely (or maybe impossible) for a diagonal to end up between 2 directly adjacent pixels, but far more likely for a directly adjacent pixel to end up between 2 diagonals.

---

If you end now, you might notice with very organic shaped circuits there might be nodes that end up right next to each other, or groups of nodes in blobs. (For example, the following shape has 5 nodes:)

![Example of invalid node configuration](https://i.imgur.com/sLxYOPQ.png)

Obviously this is undesirable: we only want the center pixel to be marked as a node. We also do not want to remove nodes around voltage sources and the other special cases, so those are marked "immutable" and cannot be trimmed.

In the code, a node is immutable and directly adjacent to the target if the immutable_map = 1, or diagonally adjacent if = 2

---

Immutable nodes cannot be trimmed unless an immutable node is diagonally adjacent to its target AND is touching an immutable node directly adjacent to its target, in which the diagonal node is redundant:

![Redundant node diagram](https://i.imgur.com/9I9rERo.png)

As we trim the nodes, we assign every node a numeric ID starting from 2 (1 means part of skeleton, 0 means not part of skeleton).

To trim node clusters, we simply do a floodfill, take the average location of all nodes in the cluster and set that sole location to be a node, clearing all others. In the event the average location was NOT originally a node, the closest node in the cluster to the average location will be picked.

**Exceptions to trimming clusters using average location:** 
- **3 Nodes, all x or y values are the same (a line)**: 
For small 1 px circuits, a 3 px wide line will be considered as 3 nodes. However, if we average the result, only the center pixel will remain, but we wish for the edge pixels to be nodes (see diagram:)

![Desired trim](https://i.imgur.com/vI0KSKh.png)

The solution is to simply delete the center pixel.

- **Clusters of > 5 nodes:**
Clusters larger than 5 nodes are formed by 1 px meshes, ie:

![Large node cluster](https://i.imgur.com/npFCS9q.png)

The solution is to count only directly adjacent pixels when considering nodes: nodes with > 2 *directly* adjacent pixels are classified as nodes, others are not.

We choose > 5 pixels because 5 pixels is the number of pixels in a star arrangement that can be reduced to 1 node, whereas any higher would indicate a 1px mesh with *multiple* nodes.

---

Finding branches (interchangeably called edges) is simply floodfilling from nodes.

Starting at each node, we take priority over directly adjacent skeleton pixels and begin calling the add branch function described below. Next, we floodfill any diagonals that is NOT touching a directly adjacent skeleton pixel.

![Diagram of floodfill start](https://i.imgur.com/jFwHSws.png)

We call the floodfill function twice as sometimes the skeletonization algorithm creates 2 branches that merge a pixel before the node (as we trimmed the nodes). The efficiency decrease is negligible as the branch algorithm maps where its visited, so calling it twice when there is only 1 branch will cause it to terminate on the first pixel.

---
Upon finding another node that's not the start node, the floodfill terminates. Floodfill also terminates if its unable to find another pixel that hasn't been visited before.

Floodfill takes the following priority list:
```
New node cannot be within 1 px of start node:
1. Directly adjacent NODES
2. Directly adjacent pixels (any)
3. Diagonally adjacent NODES
4. Diagonally adjacent pixels (any)

Repeat, but new node can be within 1 px of start node:
1. Directly adjacent NODES
2. Directly adjacent pixels (any)
3. Diagonally adjacent NODES
4. Diagonally adjacent pixels (any)
```

This search order guarantees we hit most of the pixels in the skeleton while not skipping over nodes. We permanently delete skeleton pixels as we traverse over them so other branches don't use them, the exception is pixels 1 px from a node, which may be traversed multiple times.

We first ignore pixels within 1 px of start node to avoid making circular loops around start, and force the algorithm to traverse further. But this skips over a pixel in artificial 1 px L shapes, so we traverse again.

If we find an end node, we add the branch to a branch map, otherwise we add it to a map of floating branches.

As we floodfill, we keep track of the following variables, the important ones are:
```
IDs of particles (Only directly on the skeleton)
ids      - Vector of ids of conductors
rspk_ids - Vector of ids of RSPK
switches - Vector of ids of switches

total_resistance - Equivalent resistance of the branch (includes end node, but not start)
total_voltage    - Equivalent voltage source of the branch, this overrides resistance
current_voltage  - Used for polarity measurements

diode_type     - 0 = branch is not a diode, 1 = positive diode, 2 = negative diode
polarity       - Track polarity of objects such as VOLT and diodes, 0, 1 = positive, -1 = negative
```

Polarity resets to 0 on non-terminal/[polarized element such as VOLT] particle, is 1 on positive terminal and -1 on negative terminal.

**Adding to total voltage:**
![Voltage polarity diagram](https://i.imgur.com/WKSG1Gg.png)

If none of the above conditions are met then the voltage source is improperly connected (ie PSCN - VOLT - PSCN) and will not contribute to the total voltage. By default VOLT has super high resistance, so if total_voltage is 0 (invalid voltage source), then the branch will be treated as a  high-value resistor. Groups of voltage sources are averaged, so connecting through a blob of 10 V VOLT sources won't output 100 V.

**Diode polarity:**
![Diode polarity chart](https://i.imgur.com/nKNvEou.png)

The diode value = 1 if the branch is a diode and allows positive current, = - 1 if it only allows negative current, or = 0 if not a diode at all.

**Current polarity convention:**
By convention, positive current goes from start_node to end_node, where start_node < end_node. If floodfill discovers this is not the case, it swaps the nodes, reverses rspk_ids and takes the negative of the voltage.

Once the branch is created, it calculates if it's "dynamic" (has a component that updates every frame, such as a capacitor), and is classified as ohmiam (obeys ohm's law), a diode, capacitor, inductor, voltage source or other based on variables set.

1 px floating branches are ignored as they could be part of a node that was trimmed.

**Limitations:** This method does not guarantee a node has to be actually connected to anything.





## 2. Solve circuit
If the circuit contains no dynamic components solving is limited to every 20 frames (to update for console commands and such), as resistances will be static, and any changes to the circuit will trigger a regeneration.

Solving the circuit is done with nodal analysis. Initially all nodes are solved by setting the sum of currents into the node to 0 (KCL). For example, the equation for node1 in the following diagram is:

![Equation KCL](https://i.imgur.com/IkmeoUC.png)

Using ohm's law to determine the current through each resistor as the difference in voltage, and summing the currents to 0. The actual matrix is solved using the eigen linear algebra library.

If a circuit contains components that require numeric integration, the circuit will be solved for steady-state voltage and current too in a copy of the Circuit. (capacitors are open, inductors are short). These steady state values are saved to the branches containing the respective inductors / capacitors.

**Ground:**

If the node is a ground node, the equation is simply node = 0 (ground = 0V).

**Switches:** 

Each branch has a "base resistance" and an "effective resistance". The base resistance is the resistance of non-dynamic parts, whereas the effective resistance considers dynamic parts such as switches. The resistance is updated before the nodal calculation to consider these values.

**Voltage sources:**

If the current node contains a branch that is a voltage source, KCL is carried out as normal. After the matrix is generated (but not solved), a supernode equation is used:

![Supernode equations](https://i.imgur.com/Mu0vtIh.png)

This is done by adding one of the rows of the matrix of the 2 ends of the branch of the voltage source into the other, then setting the other one to the supernode definition equation. Example:

![Supernode part 2](https://i.imgur.com/R27Gvol.png)

**Capacitors:**

Capacitors are simply "dynamic voltage sources" that obey the equation i = c dV/dt. The current through the capacitor, divided by the capacitance, is the derivative of voltage. The voltage source value is then multiplied by a timestamp (default: 1/60 s) and added to the original voltage using Euler's method.

(Preferably, we would've used something like a midpoint-eulers or Runge-Kutta, but saving additional floats to each CPTR particle or re-evaluating currents in the future timesteps were considered too costly.)

**Inductors (Current sources):**

Inductors are current sources that obey the equation V = L di/dt. The derivative of current is the voltage across divided by the inductance, and this value updates the current source value using Euler's method.

Current sources are modeled by changing what the current leaving the circuit has to equal at the nodes. Normally, the currents sum to 0, but now the current source branch is ignored, and the total current equals the current source value (or the negative, depending on polarity).

**NTCT / PTCT / Other dynamic resistors:**

NTCT / PTCT, despite their names, do not behave at all like normal temperature-coefficient semiconductors (which have exponential change to resistance based on temperature). Rather, they behave as they work for SPRK: for NTCT, at above 100 C the resistance tends to infinity, and decreases logarithmically as the temperature decreases (PTCT is opposite). This creates an incredibly rapid increase in resistance as temperature reaches the limit.

![Chart of PTCT/NTCT](https://i.imgur.com/E0JV4G6.png)

*Graph of effective resistance as a function of temperature (kelvin)*


**Diodes:**

To save time doing newton approximations and solving diode equations, our diodes are *very* ideal:

![V-I diode graph](https://i.imgur.com/1o7LG3q.png)

The only realistic thing about our diodes is that it has a breakdown and forward voltage. For ease of use, breakdown is defined as -1000 V and forward as 0.7 V.

When diodes are present, after initially solving the matrix, the voltage across each diode is considered. If the voltage is in the right direction and does not meet V_forward or is the wrong polarity and does not meet V_breakdown, then the diode does not conduct, and gets a 10 gigaohm boost to its resistance. Otherwise, the diode is replaced with a -0.7 V voltage source. The matrix is re-computed once again (not recomputed again after this).

--- 

After solving, branches are assigned node voltages and currents, and floating branches are set to the voltage of the node they're connected to (no current).

When setting currents, branches are separated depending on whether they obey ohm's law. Branches that obey ohms law simply have their current calculated from voltage drop and resistance, branches that don't "copy" the current from a branch that has the same start node. We can do this because non-ohmic branches (such as voltage sources, capacitors, etc...) must be connected on both ends to another node to function. Polarity is considered when copying so the polarity of current in both branches agree (Ie: If A -> B is positive current, then B -> C will have positive current, OR: C -> B has positive current, depending on which node is sorted first).

**Nodes that don't connect to anything:**

Function exactly the same as a ground node. We can't leave it alone because otherwise the matrix would have an empty row / col and thus be unsolvable via inversion.





## 3. Translate solution to simulation
All branches are iterated and the following is done:
```
End nodes are assigned branch current and end voltages
All RSPK has life reset to 4
Floating branches have current set to 0 and voltage to whatever voltage they are
```

For voltages in the branch, if the branch does not obey ohm's law the voltage is simply node1 voltage. If it does obey ohm's law, the voltage drop (calculated by V = IR) is done per pixel along the skeleton and set as one traverses from node1 to node2.

---

For capacitors and inductors, if the current (for inductors) or voltage (for capacitors) (after adding the current simulation step) would exceed the steady state current / voltage, the value is set to the steady state voltage / current. Similarly, if the value is really close to steady state, it's simply set to steady state.

The reason for this is because numeric integration likes to diverge for really small time constants (time constant is much smaller than the integration timestep). Since our timesteps are huge (1/60 s), divergence is very easy to occur, which creates voltages and currents that tend to infinity. Thus, we must limit the values at steady state before they are updated into the simulation, and potentially cause entire circuits to burst into flames.


## 4.


## 5. Additional circuit features
**Capacitor explosions:**

Capacitors explode when the current through them passes a certain threshold (to avoid shorts causing NaN voltages or currents due to a very fast growth of voltage), and if 1 or more amps passes through in the wrong direction (opposite polarity). The later is detected by having each CPTR particle locate a positive terminal, then checking if the voltage drop is in the right direction before checking current.

Capacitors explode based on the following rule set:
```
< 0.01 capacitance: Sizzle into SMKE, very small temp and pressure increase.
< 10 capacitance: Explode into steam and BRMT
< 100 capacitance: Explode into fire and BRMT
else: Explode into superheated EXOT
```
(EXOT implies you somehow made an electrolytic capacitor using EXOT (I mean how else did you get such high capacitance?)
